# SLIC

This notebook implements a superpixel algorithm called Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) that clusters pixels in the five-dimensional color and pixel coordinate space (e.g., r, g, b, x, y). This algorithm improves image segmentation results by  using distance function to compare the similarity between two 5D pixels.
